# django-multi-forms
Method for multiple forms in one view on one page

## notes
This is not a Django app for use within a project. It's a simple example of how to accomplish using multipel forms in one view on one page. You should be able to copy the code into your project and make it work with minimal effort, provided you are already using class-based views.
